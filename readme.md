# Tidy Design Principles

This repository contains files that follow the book [Tidy Design Principles](https://design.tidyverse.org/) by Hadley Wickham.

You may want to follow Hadley's [Tidy design principles](https://tidydesign.substack.com/) blog on Substack.

Another great resource is the [styler](https://styler.r-lib.org/) package that automatically reformats your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html), which was originally derived from the [Google R style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html), (although the latter now builds on the first).
